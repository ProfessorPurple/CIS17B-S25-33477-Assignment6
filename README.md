This is the entire root folder of my program from working in QT. 
I know in the lectures the scriber fella had mentioned utilizing some .exe in the debug folder that is within but i wanted to ensure it runs well for all so i included this all.

------------

The code is fairly straightforward.  Took the basics of the previous project and did some sleuthing to find how to translate it into a QT friendly code. 
All classes are seperated into their own files for ease of knowing who is where, this is changed from the original project where the class declarations were in the main.cpp.

I have some structured GUI attempts with text boxes aligned and in their respective sections. I was unsure how to add some prettier line breaks to further help out with differentation but I think it looks okay. 

Provided are two sort buttons that will sort by ascending order, and another that will reset the sort.

How to run:
Extract entire folder, and open the .pro file in QT. This will allow you to view the files in its native work space as well as run the program through the run program button on the QT application.

The program presents you with a single window that has some text fields on the left for adding as well as buttons and a text field on the right to find and delete items from the list. There is also a header that will exit out of the program entirely and a about section that presents a pop up of the assignment name and my name. Mouse and keyboard navigation is the full focus of the app. Enjoy!
